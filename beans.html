    At the heart of every cup is a story — of farmers, roasters, and passion. We carefully source our beans from ethical farms that value sustainability and fairness.
    Each roast is tested and tasted until it meets our standards of richness and depth. We believe coffee should feel like a warm conversation, honest and full of care.

  <h2>Responsible Sourcing</h2>
  <div class="row2">
  <p>
    Great coffee begins with great responsibility. From the farms we partner with to the cups we serve, we’re committed to making choices that care for the planet.
    We work directly with growers who follow ethical and sustainable practices, ensuring quality in every bean and fairness in every step.
    Because making a difference matters — one cup at a time.
