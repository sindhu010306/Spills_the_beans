          We got the idea for this cafe back in 2023 while we were still in college.
          What started as a simple conversation between friends over a cup of chai
          turned into something bigger. We dreamed of creating a space that blends
          great food, thoughtful design, and meaningful conversations. Over the months,
          we worked hard — brainstorming, researching, and building — and that passion
          turned into what you're experiencing today.
          Our journey has just begun, but we’re proud of how far we’ve come.
          Welcome to our space.

          What started as a simple love for great coffee turned into a dream — to create a space where people could pause, connect, and feel at home. Inspired by warm conversations and cozy corners, we built this coffee shop with care, one cup at a time. Every detail, from our handpicked beans to the music playing softly in the background, reflects our passion for comfort, quality, and community. This is more than just coffee — it’s a story brewed with heart.
