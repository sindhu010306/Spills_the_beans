    <h2>Our Missions and Values</h2>

    <div class="row2">
    <p >
      We value people — their time, their emotions, their stories.  
      At our core, we believe in kindness, hospitality, and creating meaningful connections through every dish we serve.
    </p>

      Our mission is simple: to build a space that feels like home,  
      where every cup of coffee, every plate of food, and every conversation carries intention and care.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row2">
    <p >
      We respect the time people choose to spend with us.  
      That’s why we aim to serve not just meals, but moments — authentic, unhurried, and memorable.
    </p>

      Our team shares a belief: every person who walks through our doors  
      should leave feeling lighter, inspired, or simply heard. That is our value. That is our promise.
